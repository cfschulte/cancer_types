I've been developing a set of tools accessing and managing MySQL databases via 
a web interface using HTML5, CSS3, PHP, and JavaScript. This is a demonstration 
application using those tools. Hopefully, it will also be useful for the Department
of Human Oncology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine an Public 
Health (UW-SMPH). It is an ongoing list of Cancer types and information about them.
